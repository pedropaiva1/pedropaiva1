<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Pedro Paiva</h1>


-  Software Engineer.

## About my work

I'm currently working in the area of software development focused on solutions for microservices hosted in the cloud (AWS), with high criticality and availability. This system is responsible for managing the lifecycle of more than 30 million subscriptions and processing millions of transactions per day.

I have experience with Stack SpringBoot (Java), Node.js (NestJS - React - NextJS), TypeScript, mainly focused on the development of microservices and Rest solutions. I also have experience working with agile methodology, focused on continuous improvement in all sectors of the team.

Experience with Amazon Web Services infrastructure, creation of lambdas functions in Python 3, and platform tools such as ECS, EC2, DynamoDB, PostgresSQL and Redis.

Furthermore, I have considerable experience in Monoliths developed with Microsoft technology (.NET 5), and Git domain for code versioning. I have experience with viewing logs with ElasticSearch, and monitoring using NewRelic.

I'm always looking for new challenges, building a profile of leadership and team confidence.
